          In a year that stretched and challenged us all in unexpected ways,
          Student Affairs rose to meet the moment again and again. While I am
          never surprised at the resiliency and creativity of our team, this
          yearâ€™s accomplishments clearly highlight all the ways that Student
          Affairs lived our mission #forthestudents.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you share in celebrating all these efforts and more in Student
          Affairs over the past year, thank you, as ever, for all that you do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in the most challenging times, we are deeply blessed and proud
          for such an exceptional team in Student Affairs and the opportunity to
          serve the best students in the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          This year, Student Affairs also expanded efforts to engage, advise,
          and support students and student leaders across the campus experience.
